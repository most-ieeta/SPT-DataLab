/*
  
1 Overview.
  
This class (IntByReference) let us pass integers by reference to a method.
Due to the way as java pass the parameters to the methods (always by value,
never by  reference), a modified object can be returned as parameter
(getting a side effect), but the object can not be replaced by a different
object, because the handle is passed by value. In the same way, a primitive
value can not be changed an returned as argument to the caller method. This
is why we use an IntByReference object instead an int primitive parameter
in some internals methods in the Secondo() public method in the
SecondoInterface class.

It is part of the package:

2.1 Public fields.

 The next public fields are defined in the IntByReference class and hence they are accessible by the user code.

3.3.2 the IntByReference(int val) constructor.

 This constructor creates a new IntByReference object with value = val.
